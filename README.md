This repository stores the code for my video game called "Dungeon Quest." All of the packages and classes for my code are in the source (src) folder.

In this video game, your goal is to escape a randomly generated maze with mobs such as spiders, spikes, and peashooters trying to hunt you down.
There are further instructions about the game in the instructions menu of the game.
There are 3 different difficulty modes that you can play this game in, which are: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
If you have successfully reached the finish of this randomly generated maze, the time that it took to complete it will be displayed.
Try to obtain the fastest time to complete the maze in each difficulty mode.
